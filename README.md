Objective: simpler password management


## How it works

1. Visit https://simpler.pw/
2. Login with any username and password (to encrypt your generated passwords)
3. Enter any mnemonic word, then click "OK"

You will now see your generated password. Simple!


## Details

* Your username and password are not saved anywhere (see the JavaScript source)
* Your username, password & mnemonic word are sent over secure HTTPS connections
* It's better *not to copy/paste the generated password using the clipboard*
* This service uses virtually no JavaScript in the web browser, for security
