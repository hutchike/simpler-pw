Simpler.pw
==========

Objective: simpler password management


## How it works

1. Visit https://simpler.pw/pass
2. Login with any username, and your chosen *master password*
3. Enter any word, then click "OK" to have it encrypted with your password

You will now see your generated password. Simple! (Finally, click on "Clear")


## Details

* Your username and password are not saved anywhere (see the JavaScript source)
* Your username, password & mnemonic word are sent over secure HTTPS connections
* It's better *not to copy/paste the generated password using the clipboard*
* This service uses very little JavaScript in the web browser, for security
* Be sure to click "Clear" after using the password, to remove browser history
