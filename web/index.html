    <h1>Welcome to simpler.pw</h1>

    <p>Hate forgetting passwords? Me too. That&#8217;s why I made simpler.pw - a simple way to remember passwords, in a safe and secure way that&#8217;s different.</p>

    <p>How is it different? Simpler.pw only does one thing: it transforms a memorable word into a secure password you can use as a login. When you need the password, just visit <a href="https://simpler.pw/password/">simpler.pw/password</a>, enter the memorable word, and voila! Your password appears!</p>

    <p>Here&#8217;s an example. If I type &#8220;tweet&#8221;, then click &#8220;OK&#8221;, I see the corresponding password &#8220;Yb3NPTlsb&#8221;. Maybe &#8220;tweet&#8221; is the memorable word that I use when I log into twitter.com just for example.</p>

    <p>But how can you be sure your passwords are different than mine? You use a &#8220;master password&#8221; when you log into simpler.pw so that your master password is used to generate all your paswords from memorable words.</p>

    <p>This simpler.pw website does not store or monitor any usage. It&#8217;s just a simple way to transform memorable words into passwords.</p>

    <p>I sincerely hope it&#8217;s useful for you.</p>
